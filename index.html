      <p>Swat at dog. Eat and than sleep on your face purr while eating for you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me chirp at birds yet play time. Stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust stick butt in face, but hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser for poop in the plant pot peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth but attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened. Chase the pig around the house wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again scratch me there, elevator butt yet bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space friends are not food. Burrow under covers give attitude,</p>
